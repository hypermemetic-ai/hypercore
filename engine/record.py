"""The one record — how an act lands durably and reaches git, single-writer.

The tree is hypercore's source of truth, but *writing* it is a concern of its own: an act lands on
disk atomically the instant it is made, and the durable git commit follows behind, never gating the
act (intent §work). This module is that write layer, the floor the tree's mutations and the fold rest
on. It hides three things behind a small interface:

- **`atomic_write`** — replace a file in one step (write a temp beside it, `os.replace`), so a reader
  never sees a half-written act and a crash never leaves a torn file.
- **`commit`** — stage **exactly** the named paths and commit them, swallowing failure: the act is
  already on disk, so a failed commit loses nothing. The pathspec is passed after `--`, and a caller
  hands `commit` *its own act's files* (a node's folder, a moved pair, the touched spec files), never a
  shared parent like `work/` — `git add -A -- <dir>` stages the whole subtree under a pathspec, so a
  parent pathspec would sweep a sibling worker's uncommitted change into this commit. Exact paths plus
  the held line are what actually make the record single-writer.
- **single-writer (`serialized` / `LINE`)** — concurrent workers each build in their own fence (intent
  §62), but the git-touching acts that reach the shared line must not interleave, or two `git`
  invocations collide on the index. `serialized` holds the one line across a git-touching act — a
  reentrant in-process lock backed by a repo-level `flock`, so a second `python3 -m engine`, a stray
  `git`, or the operator's editor cannot race the index either. The slow build never runs under it, so
  the record stays consistent while the builds still overlap. `transact` extends the held line to span
  a write *and* its commit as one act, so no foreign temp or half-written sibling state is ever visible
  to a concurrent `git add`.

`_root` lives here too — where the record is rooted (the repo, or `ENGINE_ROOT` under the harness) —
because it is what `commit` writes against; the tree re-exports it so its callers read one façade.
