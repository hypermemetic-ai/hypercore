# loop -- machine statements

a work address names the addressed node and one node-local work name in that node.
when no node is named, the root node is assumed.
`loop.sh -C <node-path> <gate> <work-name>` addresses work in a child node.
`loop.sh start <work-name>` creates a work node directly under the addressed node's
corpus.
`loop.sh frame`, `signoff`, `execute`, and `status` resolve the addressed node-local work and
act only on that addressed work.
`loop.sh execute <work-name>` exposes phase-two run state for the addressed work while it
runs and after recent failure or completion, including the active gate, status, harness
session id, current unit, latest message, failure reason, event history, run artifact
paths, and phase-two acceptance artifact paths.
before launching the first phase-two executor gate, `loop.sh execute <work-name>` checks
that the configured executor binary is present and that executor home/session state is
writable; a failed preflight records failed run state and stops before the executor
session starts.
`loop.sh status <work-name>` reports the addressed work's current phase and, for
non-historical work with phase-two state, the current or recent run's gate, status, state
path, event path, and latest message; `loop.sh status --json <work-name>` renders the same
run state for tooling.
from the root, `./signoff` invokes the root loop sign-off gate and preserves any explicit
arguments it receives.
`loop.sh signoff <work-name> <operator>` remains the explicit sign-off form, and for new
work it renders a concise frame-derived attestation brief through `/dev/tty`, requires the
work number as the confirming token, and writes `signed-off-by:`, `signed-off-at:`, and
`operator-gate: tty`.
`loop.sh signoff` infers the work name only when exactly one frame-complete unsigned work
node exists in the addressed node; otherwise it blocks and asks for `<work-name>`.
`loop.sh signoff` infers the operator from `HYPERCORE_OPERATOR` when set, otherwise from
the addressed node's current intent foot endorsements when exactly one operator is present;
otherwise it blocks and asks for `<operator>`.
from the root, `./direction` invokes `loop.sh direct` and preserves explicit arguments.
`loop.sh direct [<work-name> [<operator>]]` with no direction form renders the neutral
numbered options from `intent/frame/options.md` through `/dev/tty` and copies the operator's
selected option verbatim into `intent/frame/direction.md`, accepting a bare number, `n` for
none-of-these, or `q` for abort.
the explicit `loop.sh direct ... --route|--constraint|--delegate <text-or->` form is an
admin form that cannot record gated operator direction for new work; only the narrow
gate-introducing bootstrap work may record direction without the numbered selection.
`loop.sh direct` rejects empty or placeholder direction, multiple direction forms, an
existing valid direction artifact, a malformed existing direction artifact, and direction
after route content is already present.
`intent/frame/options.md` records numbered options with `kind`, `summary`, `reversibility`,
and `tradeoff`, plus `none` and `abort` rejection choices, and carries no recommendation
marker.
`direction.md` contains `direction-by:`, `direction-given-at:`, `operator-gate: tty`, and
exactly one non-placeholder `selected-route:`, `constraint:`, or `delegation:` copied from a
numbered option.
`operator-gate:` is a B-ready gate token, either `tty` or a reserved `<scheme>:<value>` such
as a later `hmac:<...>`, and only the `tty` liveness scheme is implemented.
from the root, `./review` invokes `loop.sh review` and preserves explicit arguments.
`loop.sh review <work-name> [--add <role>]...` seats the base review roster and any valid
optional complete-roster roles, then writes `intent/frame/review.md`.
new work frame completeness is checked from the canonical `intent/frame/frame.md` only;
`direction.md`, `review.md`, and `signoff.md` do not satisfy ordinary frame fields.
new work frame completeness requires these recoverable fields: addressed node,
node-local work name, target segments, work in flight, problem, constraints, decision
surface or open direction, reversibility, route, acceptance condition, observable
acceptance, excluded interpretation, proof state, sweep, and adoption or shelving claim.
`reversibility:` is parsed as exactly `one-way` or `two-way`.
`loop.sh start <work-name>` scaffolds `intent/frame/frame.md` with the lean fields.
`loop.sh frame` and `loop.sh signoff` block new work whose frame is incomplete, whose
direction is absent or malformed, whose direction appears retrospective, whose new-work
direction or sign-off lacks the `operator-gate: tty` marker, or whose one-way frame lacks a
review artifact.
one-way review artifacts record base-role verdicts, unresolved flags, and disposition;
optional reviewer verdicts cannot clear unresolved base-roster or red-team flags.
new work sign-off records `signed-off-by:`, `signed-off-at:`, and `operator-gate: tty` in
the work node's `intent/frame/signoff.md`.
`loop.sh execute <work-name>` derives implementation units from the signed frame, starts a
fresh builder session for each unit, and records lean unit handoff, diff, and tier-one
verdict artifacts under the work frame.
`loop.sh execute <work-name>` routes builders through the builder-model knob, defaulting to
the strong model until the two-step plan/build work lands, separately from the strong
review route; it gives each unit a three-attempt fast-builder budget, escalates an
exhausted unit through the strong-builder model knob, and stops for the operator when the
strong builder fails.
`loop.sh execute <work-name>` runs implementation-acceptance reviewers with literal
approval `never` and literal sandbox `read-only`.
`loop.sh execute <work-name>` writes structured acceptance artifacts with a verdict,
rationale, evidence, and a `source:` marker, refuses `HYPERCORE_ACCEPTANCE_FAKE_DIR` outside
dry-run, and lets real archive accept only `source: real-reviewer` required acceptance.
`loop.sh execute <work-name>` caches per-unit build and tier-one evidence under a
signed-frame-derived key, skips unchanged accepted units on rerun, and rebuilds cache misses
while invalidating downstream evidence.
`loop.sh execute <work-name>` treats malformed, evidence-free, or unsupported-source
implementation-acceptance output as `FLAG`, blocks unresolved required flags, and runs the
concurrent one-way tier-two panel before archive.
`loop.sh execute <work-name>` records the addressed work in node-local history after archive.
